The staging area is different in that it allows you a space to sort out
what you want to include in the repository before a commit is actually made.
This gives you a chance to organize things the way you like before a
commit is made.

Branches would be helpful in any situation where there was a desire
to try out experimental features that aren't yet relevant to the main
update commits.

The diagrams really help to understand the branch structure, because it
allows tracing back from child commits to parent commits. You can then see
how some commits are not accessible from certain checkout positions.
