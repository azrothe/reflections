The diff of the two files pinpointed the exact lines that were changed, 
allowing a focus on only those lines, greatly speeding up the process of 
finding a bug.

By having access to the entire history of a file's edits, you can easily see
where new bugs may have been introduced and at what point.

Having to manually commit means knowing when it is most logical to do so.
If there is too little or too much time in between commits, it will harder
to make sense of any changes made.

git log will show all the revisions of the file, and git diff will show
what changes were made between 2 versions of the file

You would know that you could go right to back to before the change was made
giving you confidence that any change made will ultimately be safe. This
allows you to boldly make those changes without fear.
