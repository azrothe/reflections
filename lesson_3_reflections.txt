You might want to use a remote repository when you are collaborating on a 
project and everyone on the project needs to access the latest commits.

A clone is simply a copy of a repository. A fork is a special gitHub
variant of a clone that credits the original author of the repository.
A branch is a local series of commits that is separate from other commits
in the repository that allows experimentation.

It is readily apparent that collaborating using github is a lot easier
than the old-fashioned way. You would have to manually share any changes
made and comb through text files looking for what needs to be updated
otherwise.
