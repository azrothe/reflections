You might want to use a remote repository when you are collaborating on a 
project and everyone on the project needs to access the latest commits.

A clone is simply a copy of a repository. A fork is a special gitHub
variant of a clone that credits the original author of the repository.
A branch is a local series of commits that is separate from other commits
in the repository that allows experimentation.
